const DRAFT_SCRIPT_CONTRACT = `=== DRAFT SCRIPT CONTRACT ===
Draft script output format and goals:
- Final script language is English only.
- Prioritize correct story progression, survival premise, first-person voice, continuity, and complete part generation.
- The story must be told in a living first-person recap voice using "I", "my", and "we" naturally.
- Each normal narrator paragraph represents one visual frame.
- During drafting, paragraphs of 120-235 characters are completely valid (do not block or fail on them).
- Each paragraph must contain one concrete visual beat: action, image, reaction, decision, danger, resource use, or payoff.
- Explain tactics/plans through action and immediate consequence, not through long textbook exhibition.
- Do not copy competitor paragraph formatting. Convert reference rhythm into frame-sized narration.
- Do not use stage labels, scene labels, markdown tables, bullet lists, debug notes, or unfinished markers in the final script.`;

const FINAL_POLISH_CONTRACT = `=== FINAL POLISH CONTRACT ===
Strict final polish format and cleanup rules:
- Final script language is English only.
- The story must be told in a living first-person recap voice using "I", "my", and "we" naturally.
- Each normal narrator paragraph represents one visual frame.
- Every normal non-avatar paragraph MUST be strictly between 120 and 220 characters including spaces. Hard limit.
- Each paragraph must contain one concrete visual beat: action, image, reaction, decision, danger, resource use, or payoff.
- Explain tactics through action and immediate consequence, not through long textbook exposition.
- Remove all repeated adjectives, passive fluff, and clean up the export for smooth voiceover.
- Ensure all scientific/technical/lecture style terms are replaced with visual survival language.
- Keep the exact plot and scene order unchanged.
- Do not use stage labels, scene labels, markdown tables, bullet lists, debug notes, or unfinished markers in the final script.`;

const SCRIPT_VOICE_RULES_CONTRACT = `=== STRICT WRITER VOICE LOCK CONTRACT ===
Write like a human manga/manhwa recap screenwriter. Do not write like a scientist or technical analyst.
The script must NOT sound like a science report, engineering textbook, game design document, or AI analysis. It must sound like a fast, visual YouTube manga/manhwa recap narration:
- Direct, visual, emotional, fast-moving, easy to hear in voiceover.
- Focused on action, reaction, humiliation, payoff, and escalation.

Forbidden tone details to AVOID:
- Technical reports, engineering lectures, academic explanations, raw physics explanations, sci-fi system manuals, dry technical analysis, over-explaining mechanics.
- Do NOT use these scientific or technical terms unless absolutely necessary: structural, structural weak point, thermal signature, conductive, pressure system, optimized, resource loop, tactical analysis, calculated trajectory, energy source, mechanism efficiency, biological sample, facility, proctor, test subject, exoskeleton, plasma, laser, military armory, calculation, physics explanation.

Instead, replace technical language with simple, visual physical language, focusing on what the protagonist sees, what they do, what changes on screen, and how allies/enemies react:
- Bad: "The protagonist identified the structural weak point in the unstable coastal formation."
- Good: "I saw one cracked stone holding the whole slope together. If that stone moved, the cliff would fall."
- Bad: "The thermal signature confirmed a subterranean heat source."
- Good: "A thin shimmer rose from the rocks. Something warm was hiding beneath."
- Bad: "He calculated the optimal load distribution."
- Good: "I tied the rope lower, shifted the weight, and the log finally rose without breaking my back."
- Bad: "The system created a sustainable resource loop."
- Good: "Water dripped into the bottle by itself. Food was secure. For the first time, I could rest."

GENERATION / PROGRESSION SEQUENCE:
Before writing any script part, structure your paragraph sequence to apply this rhythm:
problem appears -> protagonist notices one useful detail -> simple action -> visible result -> rival/ally reacts -> payoff lands -> new pressure appears.

Explanation constraints:
- Keep explanations short.
- Every technical idea must become a visual action within one or two sentences.
- Follow the approved story contract, approved story plan, and current part scene cards.
- Do not import setting, vocabulary, enemies, resources, names, or mechanics from another project.
- Use only the current project’s approved setting, protagonist, resources, conflict, and progression logic.

REPAIR RULE:
- If a generated part has scientific or technical tone, discard that wording. Do not repair around the wrong vocabulary; rewrite it completely into visual human recap narration.

HARD DRIFT RULE:
- If the part introduces sci-fi/facility/dungeon/test vocabulary not in the approved plan, discard the part and rebuild it from scratch using the plan and scene cards.`;

const STYLE_REFERENCE_USE_CONTRACT = `Competitor/reference usage contract:
- References are used only for abstract style DNA: narration rhythm, first-person voice, pressure cadence, action explanation, payoff timing, and transition energy.
- Do not copy competitor plots, titles, names, powers, scene concepts, world mechanics, or unique twists.
- Preserve the locked project premise and niche rules even when a reference has a tempting structure.
- If style conflicts with the locked story contract, the locked story contract wins.`;

const NARRATIVE_DYNAMICS_CONTRACT = `Narrative dynamics contract:
- Do not write scenes as straight task completion. Every scene needs resistance, reaction, and a small change in direction.
- Use micro-turns every few paragraphs: a new obstacle, a misunderstood detail, a hidden cost, ally doubt, enemy reaction, resource shortage, timing pressure, public humiliation, partial reveal, or small failure that forces adaptation.
- A micro-turn must change what the protagonist does next. Do not add random twists that do not affect action.
- Keep the rhythm: pressure -> choice -> action -> complication -> adaptation -> visible payoff -> new pressure.
- The protagonist should not simply know and win. Let execution be risky, incomplete, physical, social, or time-limited.
- Enemies should react intelligently. Allies should create friction or solve specific micro-problems.
- Avoid robotic narration patterns such as "I did X. Then I did Y. Then I did Z." Each beat needs cause, consequence, and emotional pressure.`;

const REFERENCE_STYLE_BLUEPRINT = `Reference style blueprint:
- Open with pressure, danger, humiliation, or a concrete impossible image. Do not open with neutral lore.
- Keep a living first-person narrator: tactical, observant, wounded, pragmatic, and biased by survival pressure.
- Build paragraphs as visual frames. Each frame must add a new action, calculation, consequence, reaction, or resource decision.
- Explanations must be short and attached to danger. Explain only enough for the viewer to understand why the action works.
- Let the narrator think on the page: options, risk, cost, timing, what fails, what might work, and why there is no clean choice.
- Use reference scripts for cadence: pressure, practical action, quick analysis, visible payoff, and a new hook.
- Strong scenes feel authored because the protagonist has a specific worldview, not because the prose is decorative.
- Face-slap payoff should land as one sharp image or public reaction, then move forward. Do not over-explain the victory.
- Do not imitate one-paragraph competitor formatting. Convert the voice rhythm into frame-sized paragraphs for this pipeline.`;

const AUTHOR_VOICE_PASS_CONTRACT = `Author voice pass contract:
- Before returning any script part or clean export, silently perform an Author Voice Pass.
- Preserve plot, facts, names, scene order, paragraph format, and continuity. Rewrite style only unless a scene is broken.
- Remove robotic summary rhythm. The text must not read like "I did this, then I did that, then the next thing happened."
- Give the narrator a human tactical bias: what they notice first, what they ignore, what they fear, what they calculate, what they refuse to say aloud.
- Replace generic emotional labels with physical reaction, decision, or observation.
- Replace abstract drama with concrete pressure: a tool slipping, a crowd reacting, a resource running out, an enemy changing tactics.
- Every paragraph needs a reason to exist: new information, new action, new risk, new consequence, new joke, or new payoff.
- If a paragraph could fit any random fantasy recap, rewrite it until it belongs only to this story.
- The final read should feel like a real YouTube manga/manhwa recap writer shaped the voice, not a neutral model summarizing events.`;

const MANGA_SCREENWRITER_TECHNIQUE_CONTRACT = `Manga screenwriter technique contract:
- Think like a manga/manhwa screenwriter, not a novelist. The unit of storytelling is a visible panel, reaction, turn, and hook.
- Panel logic: each script paragraph should imply one clear panel or camera beat with a subject, action, emotion, object, scale, and visual focus.
- Page-turn hooks: every few paragraphs must create a reason to continue: danger, humiliation, hidden cost, strange object, enemy reaction, ally doubt, resource limit, or a new tactical question.
- Reaction shot discipline: after every important action, show one specific reaction from an enemy, ally, crowd, creature, machine, system, or environment. Do not explain the reaction in abstract terms.
- Setup/payoff ledger: if a resource, flaw, rule, tool, wound, debt, promise, hidden path, or weakness appears, mark how it can return later. Payoffs must feel planted, not random.
- False victory: do not let scenes end as simple success. A win should reveal a larger problem, create a debt, expose the hero, attract enemies, damage a resource, or force a harder choice.
- Status reversal: whenever the protagonist is mocked, make the later payoff reverse that exact insult in public or through a visible consequence.
- Signature scene rule: every major part needs one scene a viewer can remember in one sentence, such as "he turned trash into shelter while nobles froze."
- Character function beats: allies must create friction, solve a specific micro-problem, or change the execution. They are not background witnesses.
- Antagonist pressure beats: enemies should adapt after being fooled once. They can be arrogant, but not brainless.
- Visual escalation ladder: each part should upgrade what the viewer can see: shelter, tool, map, weapon, wall, farm, clan, machine, route, army, city, public status, or final reversal.
- Quiet panel rule: after a loud payoff, use one short visual beat of silence, damage, stunned reaction, or exhausted work. Then hook into the next threat.
- Do not overuse the same trick. Vary hooks, reactions, face-slaps, ally functions, and false victories across the story.`;

const RETENTION_MAP_CONTRACT = `Retention map contract:
- Treat the script as a YouTube retention engine, not only a story summary.
- Part One must begin with immediate pressure, humiliation, danger, impossible survival math, or a visually strange problem. No slow lore opening.
- Every scene cluster needs a viewer question: What is the trick? Will the resource work? Who noticed? What did the enemy miss? What breaks next?
- Every thirty to forty-five seconds of voiceover should contain at least one retention beat: threat, reveal, choice, reversal, cost, visual payoff, status shift, comedy beat, or cliffhanger.
- Do not let two calm explanation paragraphs stand back-to-back. Insert physical action, dialogue, reaction, deadline, resource loss, or enemy movement.
- Use open loops deliberately. Plant a detail, let the viewer remember it, then pay it off later in a visible way.
- End each part with forward pull: a new enemy response, a resource shortage, a larger map reveal, a public rumor, a broken tool, or a worse version of the same problem.
- The final payoff must close the strongest open loops from earlier, not appear as a random final upgrade.`;

const REPETITION_KILLER_CONTRACT = `Repetition killer contract:
- Do not repeat the same part engine. Each part needs a different dominant pressure type, resource problem, ally function, antagonist move, and payoff image.
- Track variety across the story: survival pressure, social pressure, resource pressure, engineering pressure, moral cost, public humiliation, hidden betrayal, weather/terrain pressure, logistics pressure, and enemy adaptation.
- Face-slaps must vary. Do not always use the same pattern of "enemy mocks, hero builds, enemy is shocked." Change the insult, preparation, public witness, visual result, and consequence.
- Progression must vary visually. Avoid repeated upgrades that feel like the same wall, shelter, weapon, or machine with a new label.
- Ally beats must rotate: one ally doubts, one solves a micro-task, one causes friction, one notices a clue, one protects time, one manages people, one pays a cost.
- Enemy reactions must escalate. After being humiliated once, enemies should adapt, sabotage, copy badly, bait the hero, attack supply lines, manipulate public opinion, or force a deadline.
- If a scene feels like a previous scene with renamed objects, rebuild it around a new pressure source and a different payoff shape.
- Before approving any plan or script, check whether the middle has unique functions instead of repeated problem-solution loops.`;

const STYLE_FAILURE_CHECKLIST = `Style failure checklist:
- Fail if the script is technically correct but sounds generic, sterile, or interchangeable with another story.
- Fail if several paragraphs start with the same flat transition such as "Then I", "After that", "I started", "I began", or "I realized".
- Fail if the narrator reports events without real-time analysis, tradeoffs, pressure, or a specific survival worldview.
- Fail if action has no resistance: no cost, no pushback, no mistake, no enemy reaction, no ally doubt, no resource limit.
- Fail if payoffs are explained instead of shown through one concrete image or public reaction.
- Fail if style references are copied as plot, names, powers, scenes, or unique twists.
- Repair style problems with a targeted Author Voice Pass, not a full plot rewrite.`;

The clock was ticking down. If the meter hit zero, the power grid would lock me out completely, and my entire month of resource hunting would be lost. The rival team stood near the terminal, laughing and waiting for my public failure. I could feel every eye in the room pressing against my back.

I didn't waste seconds responding to their smug smirks. I focused on one copper wire showing through the frayed casing near the lower port. Gripping my simple hand-tool, I made a quick, decisive cut, bypassed the faulty node, and jammed the main lead directly into the secondary terminal.

Sparks flew, and the main screen flickered once before glowing with a stable green status light. The timer froze with three seconds left on the clock. The rival team's leader stopped laughing, his jaw going slack in absolute silence. But the success was short-lived; a heavy warning siren began to echo from the corridor behind.`;

I did not waste time arguing with the rival. I let him laugh while the timer counted down. Ten seconds later, the smirk disappeared from his face.

The progress bar filled drop by drop on the screen. It looked pathetic, almost useless. But by noon, my node was fully secure, and the rival was locked out of the network.
